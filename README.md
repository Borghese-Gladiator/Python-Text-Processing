# Python-Text-Processing
Flask by Example â€“ Text Processing with Requests, BeautifulSoup, and NLTK

Created project through tutorial: [https://realpython.com/flask-by-example-part-3-text-processing-with-requests-beautifulsoup-nltk/](https://realpython.com/flask-by-example-part-3-text-processing-with-requests-beautifulsoup-nltk/)

This project uses a staging, but I chose not to (due to lack of free apps Heroku)

# Tutorial Differences 
- did not use autoenv to set up environment (wrote setup.bat to create environment varialbes for local testing)
